# Hephaestus :rocket:

- In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was either the son of Zeus and Hera or he was Hera's parthenogenous child. ... As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centres of Greece, particularly Athens.

## Get Started :rocket:

- An Restful Api project developed with Flask.

- I used [Prometheus](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus-flask-exporter/) and [Grafana](https://medium.com/swlh/create-grafana-dashboards-with-python-14a6962eb06c) for monitoring and containerization with Docker.
